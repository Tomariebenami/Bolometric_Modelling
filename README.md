# Bolometric_Modelling

This Package is a tool for analysing bolometric curves of Supernovae.
The packadge uses the [lightcurve_fitting](https://github.com/griffin-h/lightcurve_fitting.git) module, to calculate bolometric lightcurves, which can then be analysed.

Currently, this package offers to fit the lightcurves to a Radioactive Decay model, and a Radioactive Decay + Circumstellar Material model.
